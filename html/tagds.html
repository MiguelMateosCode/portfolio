                  <h3>Introducción</h3>
                 <p><strong>Context and goals</strong></p> <p>At the core of The Adecco Group's digital transformation was the recognition of the need for a unified Design System, named TAG DS. This system aimed to standardize UI/UX components across all digital platforms, enhancing visual cohesion, usability, and accessibility. It facilitated the development of digital products for the group's various brands, such as Adecco, Akkodis, and LHH, streamlining processes and ensuring a consistent user experience across the brand portfolio.</p>

                  <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
                 <p>One major challenge was the diversity of existing user interfaces, developed in isolation by different teams, leading to a lack of coherence and variable accessibility standards. Conducting a comprehensive audit of the existing platforms was particularly challenging due to their disparate construction. This variability posed a significant obstacle in understanding the current state and planning for the cohesive integration of the Design System.</p>
                  <p><strong>My Role</strong></p> <p>As a Product Designer and Design System Contributor, my role was to coordinate the collaborative effort among designers, developers, and stakeholders to lay the groundwork for the design system, from the Discovery phase through to the final Construct phase. This involved documentation and publication on Zeroheight, ensuring the system met both design and business objectives.</p>

                 <div class="spacer-l"></div>
                 <p>The process began with an exhaustive research and analysis phase, including interviews with stakeholders, analysis of competitors' design systems, and workshops with User Personas defined by the Research team. This was aimed at understanding their needs and pain points.</p>

                 <div class="spacer-l"></div>
                 <p>Principles of design centered on accessibility, reusability, and simplicity were established. These principles were crucial in the creation of all components, including the Time Picker, ensuring they were intuitive and accessible to all users.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tools and software</strong></p> <p>Figma was used for design and prototyping collaboration, Zeroheight for component documentation, and Storybook for documenting and sharing system components with developers.</p>

                 <p>The Time Picker was designed to address the need for efficient and accessible time input in time management and scheduling applications. The lack of consistency in previous time input solutions had resulted in a fragmented user experience.</p>

                 <div class="spacer-l"></div>
                 <p>The design of the Time Picker started with initial sketches and wireframes, followed by interactive prototypes in Figma. Usability testing was conducted to gather feedback, leading to several design iterations to improve ease of use and accessibility. Close collaboration with developers ensured effective technical implementation consistent with the design.</p>
                  <p><strong>Integration and Standards</strong></p>
                 
                 <p>The component was rigorously tested to ensure its compatibility with WCAG accessibility standards and its smooth integration with other components of the design system, maintaining visual and functional cohesion.</p>
