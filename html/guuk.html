                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                 <p><strong>Context and Objectives</strong></p> <p>Guuk, part of the Más Móvil telecommunications group, faced the challenge of redesigning its commercial website to align with its new brand image and enhance customer engagement and experience. My role in leading the redesign involved revamping the user interface and website experience, focusing on creating visually appealing designs, intuitive navigation, and smooth interactions for visitors. Understanding Guuk's brand identity and target audience, I designed compelling layouts, graphics, and interactive elements to boost user engagement and satisfaction.</p>

                  <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            
                 <p>Guuk's customer service team was receiving a high volume of calls from customers for basic issues and needed a secondary channel on the website to address inquiries. This would relieve the only available channel at that time, which was the telephone channel.</p>

                 <div class="spacer-l"></div>
                  <p>The goal was to create a new section within the website, featuring a well-structured information architecture, enabling customers to find answers to their questions as quickly as possible.</p>

                  <h3>Design Process</h3>
                  <p><strong>Research and Analysis</strong></p>
                 
                 <p>The first step involved gathering all the common questions to optimize space on the website, enabling customers to quickly find solutions to their problems. A decision was made to implement a dynamic search engine, including a search box in a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section, thereby enhancing the user experience. This allowed visitors to swiftly find specific information tailored to their needs.</p>

                  <p><strong>Improvement of User Experience</strong></p>

                 <div class="spacer-l"></div>
                 <p>By incorporating a search engine into the FAQs, we made it easier for users to save time, improve their navigation, and easily access relevant answers without scrolling through a long list of questions and answers. This solution not only enhanced user autonomy in resolving queries but also helped reduce the load on the telephone customer service.</p>

                  <h3>Results and Impact</h2>
                
                 <p>The launch of the new FAQ section with dynamic search significantly improved customers' ability to find solutions on their own, quickly. This enhancement led to a notable increase in customer satisfaction, evidenced by fewer support calls for basic inquiries, thus freeing up resources for more complex questions. Moreover, this user-centric approach has strengthened Guuk's brand image as one that values and facilitates its customers' experience.</p>
               
                   <p><strong>Lessons learned</strong></p>
                  <p>This project emphasized the importance of deeply understanding user needs and behaviors to design effective solutions that not only address immediate challenges but also contribute to the long-term goals of the company. Collaboration between teams and integrating user feedback were key to the project's success.</p>

                  <p>The redesign of Guuk's commercial website showcases the transformative impact of a systematic and collaborative design approach on user experience and brand-customer relationship. By enhancing site navigation and information access through a dynamic FAQ section, Guuk has set a new customer service standard in the telecommunications sector, emphasizing its commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. This project not only improved user experience but also marked a significant shift in Guuk's approach to digital solution design and development.</p>
