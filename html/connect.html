                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                 <p><strong>Context and Objectives</strong></p> <p>My role was pivotal in bridging the gap between client requirements and effective design solutions. I played a key part in gathering specific needs from various countries using Adecco Connect. Through collaboration with development and business teams, I translated these requirements into actionable design solutions.</p>

<p>The goal was to enhance brand consistency and user trust by ensuring a unified and recognizable design language across platforms. Secondly, the system significantly sped up the development process, allowing for quicker responses to market demands and efficient feature rollouts. Thirdly, the system's scalability facilitated the company's digital expansion, ensuring adaptability to new platforms and technologies.</p>

                 <p>Adecco Connect was facing several issues: they were not using a design system, there were numerous usability issues and errors, the color red was being used incorrectly, and it was not responsive. To improve the product, I had to identify inconsistencies using Nielsen's heuristics and usability and accessibility rules to present the issues to various stakeholders.</p>

                  <h3>User Testing and Data</h3>
            
                 <p>Participant segmentation involved 16 usability testing sessions with Connect users, exploring the workflow to create a recruitment process. The features investigated included:

    <ul>
      <li>Setting up a new recruitment process.</li>
      <li>Scheduling a live interview.</li>
      <li>Adding a hard skill test to the process.</li>
    </ul>

                  <p><strong>Key Research Findings</strong></p>
            
              <p>The key points of the research included evaluating the overall experience of Connect and measuring the usability and satisfaction of recruiters with the new feature. The study aimed to uncover usability issues faced by real users, highlighting:
<ul>
      <li>The error rate for mistaken clicks in the drag-and-drop video functionality was 50%, indicating that the feature was not perceived as directly visible to participants.</li>
      <li>Even though participants rated the task as easy, it took them 3 clicks to achieve the task's objective.</li>
    </ul>

                 <p>The solution, informed by user testing feedback, focused on better hierarchy in typography use, improved visual separation of sections, and more optimal use of spacing. Typography hierarchy is crucial for clear communication and readability, helping to organize information so readers can easily grasp the content structure and focus on key points.</p>
